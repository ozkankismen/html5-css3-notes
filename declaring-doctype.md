The Html5 is supporting traditional HTML features in but much easier way. In HTML and XHTML, the declaration of the doctype was a bit awful, but with this new version, all we need to do is a very simple declaration.<br/>

Of course entire HTML file does not exist with only the declaration section. We will fill it up with the necessary tags.
Let's carry on with our first HTML file.<br/>

Now it is time to break it down. After the document type declaration, we need to use HTML tags to show that all the code between them will be HTML. Then we have the head section between the head tag. This section mostly contains information about the file and links to other files. Just a few tags in here will be shown to the user.<br/>
The meta tag is the first head tag that we used on our example, and it gives the information for the character set. <br/>
After that, there is a title tag for declaring the page title. This is the only tag that the browser will render and show to the user in the head section. This is an important tag, actually, because it affects search engine robots in the way of the index of your web page.<br/>
In the body section, we have a heading tag and a paragraph tag to show some text to the user. You will see the difference between them in the screenshot.<br/>

This screenshot shows how our browser will render this page, except red text and arrows. I put them for a clear explanation.
